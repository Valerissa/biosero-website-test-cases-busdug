### Objective

Write relevant test cases and scripts for the sample application http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers

### Brief

The computer database application allows users add, edit and remove historical computer information. The site was originally written by a small team of developers but it has grown beyond their ability to manage and they are looking to grow their team quickly. To ensure they don't break anything in the process they have decided they need te test what's already been deployed to ensure nothing breaks in future deployments of the application.

### Tasks

-   Create a series of manual test cases that cover the CRUD operation of the applicaiton at http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers
    -   Feel free to use any format you are comfortable with.
-   Write scripts that would automate the manual test cases that you see fit to be included in a regression test set. Please use any of below programming languages:
    -   C# (preferred)
    -   Python (preferred)
    -   Java
    -   Javascript
    -   Ruby
-   Avoid frameworks that only record test cases.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Testing** best practices
-   Make sure you give detailed instructions for each test case (pre conditions, steps, expected results)
-   If you are using a framework make sure best practices are followed for models, configuration and tests

### CodeSubmit

Please organize and push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your work, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
